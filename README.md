Horrors 2
======

This is a collection of short stories created on the Something Awful Forums in 2009.
The stories were inspired by a self-published book someone found at a used book store,
called "Horrors".
Stories in the original "Horrors" were written by a then-13-year-old,
and it shows.

We had a good time writing these,
and eventually published a print version of the book,
from a press at a University in Canada.
