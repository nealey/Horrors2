Thanks to all the goons who wrote the stories in the first place, and then
went through the hassle of going to a new thread to accept the license.

Thanks to AYBraham for giving the idea momentum in the form of a
contest.

Thanks to Hamelin for suggesting I list the authors who still needed to
assign permission, and for telling me about Mediafire, so I could host
draft copies without letting a thousand goons know who I really am.

Thanks to benitocereno for reminding me about the "any similarities"
disclaimer, which probably has no legal weight whatsoever, but looks
cool.

Last but most, thanks to Ben Biddick for inspiring 117 crappy authors
and one crappy bookmaker to come together for a great thing.  Terrible,
yes; but great.
