Thanks to all the goons who wrote the stories in the first place, and
then went through the hassle of going to a new thread to accept the
license.

Thanks to AYBraham for giving the idea momentum in the form of a
contest.

Thanks to BirdZerk! for helping me with some of the initial conversion
from the forum to LaTeX.

Thanks to Hamelin for suggesting I list the authors who still needed to
assign permission, and for telling me about Mediafire, so I could host
draft copies without letting a thousand goons know who I really am.

Thanks to benitocereno for reminding me about the "any similarities"
disclaimer, which probably has no legal weight whatsoever, but looks
cool.

Thanks to Ridgley_Fan for submitting *three* git patches, one of which
had the cool idea of putting a Beretta image on the winning stories
somewhere.

Thanks to Discount_Bees, for doing so freaking much artwork (8 pieces!)

Thanks to Part of Everything, for doing a lot of artwork too (6 pieces),
and PMing me so much that I was unable to forget that real people were
involved with this effort.

Thanks to rinski for the foreword, just when I was feeling burned out.

Last but most, thanks to Ben Biddick for inspiring 117 crappy authors
and one crappy bookmaker to come together for a great thing.  Terrible,
yes; but great.
