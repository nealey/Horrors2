A note to commiters
-------------------

You probably have git set up with your real name and email address.  If
you would like to change those to something else, remember to do so
*before* you commit anything.  You'll want to change the file

    .git/config

Here's what's at the start of mine:

    [user]
            name = "cruft"
            email = "cruft@mailinator.com"
