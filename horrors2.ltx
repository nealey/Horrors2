\chapter{Colophon}

This book is a collection of stories from the Something Awful Forums,
inspired by the 1991 book {\em Horrors} by Ben Biddick.  Most were written
as a response to a challenge by forums moderator AYBraham:

\begin{quotation}
  Your goal: Write a short story in the theme of {\em Horrors}, the collection
  of short stories written by Mr. Ben Beddick when he was 13 years
  old. Each story is encouraged to feature the tragic protagonist Luke
  Bavarius, and must be more than 500 words each. Each story must show
  that "kids need to be respected and listened to."
\end{quotation}

This book was typeset by the \LaTeX{} document preparation system, using
the {\sf book} class.

It was set in the Antykwa Toru\'nska (``Antiqua of Torun'') typeface,
the most horriffying of all the standard \TeX{}live typefaces.  The face
was designed by Zygfryd Gardzielewski (1914--2001), and first cast in
metal in 1960 in the Grafmasz typefoundry in Warsaw.  The variant used
in this document was digitized by Janusz Marian Nowacki, a tremendously
cool dude from Poland, based off of photocopies of the original design.
