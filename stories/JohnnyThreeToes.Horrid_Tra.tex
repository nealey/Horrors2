\chapter{Horrid Transformation}
\by{JohnnyThreeToes}


A man lives in that abandoned house at the end of the street. He is
old and secret, nobody knows that he is in there. Those that do
know don't suspect it is a man, but maybe a dog or a cat living in
the house. There is strange foggy weather over that house. Tonight
thunder rumbles all around the house in the air.



The man sits at his counter and does not say a word. There is no
one to say it to. He is alone. Pain is in his staring eyes. Pain
from loneliness. Depressed pain. A bowl of eaten cereal is in front
of him. He is frowning, not satisfied. Some open bags of dog food
surround him, too.



Horrid thunder surrounds his house and then there is a flash of
lightning. The man has had enough! Enough of this civilization
where people shun him for his talent. They could never understand.
The man grins and puts on a collar. There is another flash of
lightning and by the end of the flash the man has changed into a
dog. He will do what he always does tonight like every night. He
will wander around until somebody takes pity on him and pets him
and feed him. As a homeless human society hates him, but as a dog
he is the greatest thing ever to them. Life is funny that way, he
silently thinks, walking out the door into the lightning.
